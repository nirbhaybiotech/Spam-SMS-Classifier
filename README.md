# Spam-SMS-Classifier
This GitHub repo features a Spam SMS Classifier using NLP techniques, trained on a pre-processed dataset for high accuracy. Deployable with source code, data, and model weights, it helps identify and filter spam messages, improving user experience in SMS communications.
# Key Feature
Machine Learning-based: The classifier is built using machine learning algorithms, enabling it to learn from data and make accurate predictions, distinguishing spam from legitimate SMS messages.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Leveraging NLP techniques, the model can analyze and understand the content of SMS messages, capturing unique patterns and characteristics of spam texts.

High Accuracy: The classifier is trained on a pre-processed SMS dataset, resulting in a high accuracy rate in detecting spam messages, minimizing false positives, and improving overall performance.

Open Source: The entire project, including source code, dataset, and model weights, is available as an open-source repository, facilitating easy replication, collaboration, and contributions from the community.

Easy Integration: Users can seamlessly integrate the classifier into their own applications or systems, enhancing SMS security and providing a better user experience by filtering out unwanted spam messages.

Scalable: The model is designed to handle a large volume of SMS messages, making it suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios with significant SMS traffic.

Versatile Dataset: The pre-processed dataset used for training covers a wide range of spam text examples, making the classifier adaptable to different types and variations of spam messages.

Continuously Updated: The repository is maintained and regularly updated to ensure the classifier's efficiency and effectiveness against evolving spam techniques.

Ethical Considerations: The project follows strict ethical guidelines, respecting user privacy and freedom of expression while combating spam to promote responsible use of the technology.
